# Citibike Challenge
In this project, data was retrieved from the Citibike database in order to create a story in Tableau about the data trends found within that time frame.

# Notes for Visualizations
-Please note that when you are looking at the story on Tableau, make sure to view it in full-screen wide screen format.

-The data was further transformed via Jupyter Notebook, a copy of which is contained on this repository

# Analysis
From the analysis for the March 2023 data there are two main things I wanted to focus on: The most popular stations and the customer type and habits.  

On the customer dashboard, we can get a sense of the average customer for Citibike.  According to the associated pie charts, our customers are most commonly Citibike members who prefer a manual bike.  By the heat map, we can tell that many of the trips start in the morning hours and the afternoon around rush hour. Of the over 2 million trips in March, on average they are only 13 minutes long.  

On the station dashboard, there are bar charts for the most popular starting points and the most popular end points, which correspond to the nearest map and bubble chart. By selecting one of the stations on the bar charts, you can show all connecting trips to that location amongst the other top 20 locations.  In this manner we can see if there is common travel amongst these sites.  What I have found is that although most trips start or stop at these locations overall, the corresponding destination to one of those points is often one of the less popular destinations.  

With all the combined data between the two dashboards we can establish the basic outline of our average user.  Most of our users are city people who work within a 13-minute bike ride of their homes (average bike ride). The average user becomes a member of Citibike since they will regularly need a bike to commute to their respective offices, and most likely choose a manual bike possibly for the added benefit of a small workout.  Due to most trips starting during the typical morning and afternoon rush hours (see the heatmap), it can be inferred that the bikes are being used to get to and return from work.  This is reinforced by the idea that the most popular starting and end stations are all downtown and rather close together, and that these trips themselves are not often between these points.  To put it simply, these urban professionals are taking a bike in to work and getting a new bike from the same station to go home at night.
